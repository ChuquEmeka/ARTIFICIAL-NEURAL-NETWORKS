# ARTIFICIAL-NEURAL-NETWORKS
CONCRETE STRENGTH PREDICTION USING ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS PRESENTED BY: EDEH EMEKA N. In this Analysis, I will be predicting the strength of concrete using the given eight features that describe the components used in the mixture.These features are believed to be related to the final compressive strength which include the amount of cement in Kilograms per cubic meter, Blast.Furnace.Slag, Fly.Ash, water,superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, fine aggregate and aging period measured in days.Â¶ The dataset was donated to UCI Machine Learning Data Repository by I-Cheng Yeh
